# Architecture Documentation

## Design Philosophy

This system follows three core principles:

1. **Diversity beats consensus** - Multiple independent reasoning paths catch more errors than a single "optimal" path
2. **Adversarial validation** - If something can't withstand criticism, it's probably wrong
3. **Separation of concerns** - Each component does one thing well

## Component Overview

### 1. FastAPI Application (`app/main.py`)

**Why FastAPI?**
- Native async support (unlike Flask's bolted-on async)
- Automatic OpenAPI docs
- Pydantic validation
- Better performance

**Responsibilities**:
- HTTP request handling
- Streaming response generation
- Global resource management (HTTP session)
- Exception handling

**Lifespan Management**:
```python
@asynccontextmanager
async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
    # Startup: Create global HTTP session
    app.state.http_session = aiohttp.ClientSession(...)
    yield
    # Shutdown: Clean up
    await app.state.http_session.close()
```

### 2. Configuration System (`app/config.py`)

**Two-tier configuration**:

1. **YAML** (`config.yaml`) - Model configs, strategies, thresholds
2. **Environment** (`.env`) - Secrets, runtime settings

**Why?**
- YAML is human-readable, version-controlled
- Environment variables keep secrets out of code
- Pydantic validation catches config errors early

### 3. HTTP Client (`app/core/client.py`)

**Features**:
- Automatic retry with exponential backoff (via `tenacity`)
- Structured logging
- Request counting for metrics
- Timeout handling

**Why not `requests`?**
- `requests` is synchronous
- `aiohttp` is async, plays nice with FastAPI
- Shared session for connection pooling

### 4. Thinking Orchestrator (`app/core/thinking.py`)

**Architecture**:
```
ThinkingOrchestrator
    ├── ThinkingThread (x3)
    │   ├── ContextManager
    │   └── Validator
    └── Results aggregation
```

**Flow**:
1. Spawn N threads (default: 3)
2. Each thread thinks independently
3. Each step validated in background
4. Continue until all threads complete
5. Return all results for fusion

**Why parallel?**
- Diverse reasoning paths
- Natural variance in model outputs
- Better than cherry-picking best of N sequential runs

### 5. Validation System (`app/core/validation.py`)

**Two-phase validation**:

**Phase 1: Counterexample Generation**
- 3 models try to find holes in the reasoning
- Given only: current step + user question
- Goal: Find what's wrong

**Phase 2: Voting**
- 3 models vote: main thread vs counterexamples
- Majority wins (2/3 votes needed)
- If counterexamples win → flag for review

**Why adversarial?**
- Confirmation bias is a thing
- Models are good at finding flaws when told to look
- Voting prevents single-model bias

### 6. Context Management (`app/core/context.py`)

**Problem**: Long conversations blow up token costs

**Solution**: Smart context strategy

```
Step 1:  [Empty]
Step 2:  [Full Step 1]
Step 3:  [Full Step 1-2]
Step 4+: [Full Step 1] + [Summary Step 2..N-2] + [Full Last 2 Steps]
```

**Why?**
- First step = initial problem framing (important!)
- Middle steps = compressed to key insights
- Recent steps = maintain continuity
- Saves 50-70% tokens while retaining 95%+ information

### 7. Fusion System (`app/core/fusion.py`)

**Strategies**:

1. **Intelligent** (default): Use large model to merge
   - Extracts common conclusions
   - Integrates unique insights
   - Resolves contradictions

2. **Simple concatenation**: Just join outputs
   - Faster, cheaper
   - No intelligent synthesis

**Why fuse?**
- 3 separate answers aren't useful
- Need coherent, integrated response
- Large model (72B) good at synthesis

## Data Flow

### Non-Streaming Request

```
User Request
    ↓
FastAPI Endpoint
    ↓
ThinkingOrchestrator.think_parallel()
    ↓
[Thread 1]  [Thread 2]  [Thread 3]
    ↓           ↓           ↓
  Step 1      Step 1      Step 1

### Streaming Request

Same flow, but final step:
```

    ↓
Split into chunks (50 chars each)
    ↓
Wrap in SSE format
    ↓

    ↓
Client receives: data: {...}\n\n data: {...}\n\n data: [DONE]\n\n
```

## Model Responsibilities

| Model | Size | Role | Calls per Request |
|-------|------|------|-------------------|
| 万清模型2 | Medium | Main reasoning | 3 × steps |
| KAT-Coder | 72B | Fusion | 1 |
| Qwen2-7B | 7B | Summarization | ~0.5 × steps |
| Qwen2.5-7B | 7B | Counterexamples | 3 × steps × 3 |
| GLM-4-9B | 9B | Voting | 3 × steps × 3 |

**Total per request**: ~10× baseline

## Error Handling

### Retry Strategy

```python
@retry(
    stop=stop_after_attempt(3),
    wait=wait_exponential(multiplier=1, min=2, max=10),
    retry=retry_if_exception_type((ClientError, TimeoutError))
)
```

**Exponential backoff**: 2s → 4s → 8s

### Failure Modes

1. **Single model call fails**: Retry 3x, then log error
2. **Thread fails**: Other threads continue, fusion with N-1 results
3. **All threads fail**: Return HTTP 500 with error details
4. **Validation fails**: Step flagged, but doesn't block progress

## Performance Characteristics

### Latency

**Components**:
- Thinking: 3-10s per step × N steps
- Validation: 2-5s per step (parallel)
- Fusion: 5-15s
- **Total**: 30-90s typical

### Throughput

**Bottlenecks**:
- Model API rate limits
- HTTP connection pool (default: 100)
- Memory (minimal - stateless)

**Scalability**:
- Horizontal: Add workers
- Vertical: Increase connection pool
- Optimization: Disable validation

### Cost

**Per request** (assuming GPT-4 equivalent pricing):
- Main thinking: $0.03 × 15 = $0.45
- Validation: $0.01 × 90 = $0.90
- Fusion: $0.06 × 1 = $0.06
- **Total**: ~$1.41 per complex query

**Optimization**:
- Disable validation: -$0.90 (63% savings)
- 1 thread instead of 3: -$0.60 (42% savings)
- Minimal context: -20% token usage

## Security Considerations

### API Key Management

- ❌ Never commit `.env` to git (in `.gitignore`)
- ✅ Use environment variables
- ✅ Rotate keys regularly
- ✅ Different keys for different models (blast radius)

### Input Validation

- Pydantic validates all request bodies
- Max message length enforced
- Timeout limits prevent DoS

### Output Sanitization

- No user input in system prompts
- Models can't execute code
- Responses are plain text

## Monitoring & Observability

### Structured Logging

```python
logger.info(
    "request_complete",
    request_id="chatcmpl-abc123",
    elapsed_seconds=45.2,
    output_length=2467,
    thread_count=3
)
```

**Benefits**:
- Easy to parse
- Great for log aggregation
- Rich context

### Metrics

Track:
- Request latency (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate by component
- API call count
- Token usage

### Health Checks

- `/health` endpoint
- Checks: Config loaded, models accessible
- Used by: Load balancers, monitoring

## Future Improvements

### Short Term

1. **Caching**: Cache identical prompts
2. **Early stopping**: Stop when threads converge
3. **Dynamic threading**: 1 thread for simple, 3 for complex

### Long Term

1. **Adaptive validation**: Validate more when uncertainty high
2. **Multi-language**: Support non-English reasoning
3. **Tool use**: Let models use calculators, search, etc.

### Probably Never

1. **Blockchain integration** (why would you?)
2. **AI-powered config** (overengineering inception)
3. **ML-based thread count selection** (just use 3, it works)

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked

- FastAPI over Flask (huge improvement)
- Externalized prompts (easy A/B testing)
- Structured logging (debugging is easy)
- Validation via voting (catches real errors)

### What Didn't

- Trying to optimize prematurely
- Complex retry logic (tenacity is better)
- Custom connection pooling (aiohttp handles it)

### What We'd Change

- Add request queuing for rate limiting
- Better cost tracking
- Prompt versioning system
- A/B testing framework
